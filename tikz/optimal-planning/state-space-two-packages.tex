:Title: A simple graph-model in 3D
:slug: 3d-graph-model

A simple graph-model in 3D with a helping grid but not with a rotation of 45 degrees to avoid overlapping edges. The graph lines are drawn with a white background to visualize the ones closer to the viewer and hence improve the 3D-view. Code duplication is reduced.
